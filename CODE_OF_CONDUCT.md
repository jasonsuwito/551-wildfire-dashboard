We strive to foster a collaborative and supportive atmosphere that encourages both learning and innovation. To uphold these principles, all contributors must agree to the following guidelines:

* **Respecting diverse perspectives**: All contributions and viewpoints will be received with respect, kindness, and an open-mind fostering an environment conducive to productive dialogue.
* **Using inclusive language**: We are dedicated to ensuring that all members feel valued and respected. This is achieved through the consistent use of inclusive and appropriate language.
* **Respecting membersâ€™ time and schedules**: Acknowledging that individual schedules may occasionally vary, all members agree to be mindful of potential time constraints and limitations that may arise.
* **Recognizing effort and contributions**: We actively support and uplift one another by recognizing the hard-work and contributions of all members, reinforcing a culture of mutual respect and encouragement.
* **Prioritizing empathy**: Interactions will be guided by compassion and understanding, regardless of the challenges that may arise, ensuring a supportive environment for everyone involved. 
* **Providing and receiving constructive feedback**: Feedback will be offered in a constructive and considerate manner, with the goal of continuous improvement.
