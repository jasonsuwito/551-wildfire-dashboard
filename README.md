The landing page of the app will be a full map of Canada, showing the fires between 2013 and 2023, emphasizing the quantity of fires which occurred in BC alone. We then transition to the main dashboard showcasing our primary analysis.The dashboard will contain data visualizations that shows the distribution (bar chart, histogram, contour plot, heatmap etc) of features in the data set (fire size, location, date (year, month, day), etc.).
