**Name**: Amali Jayatileke, Kiran John, Kelsey Strachan, Jason Suwito

**Published**: February 14, 2025

### Work Expectations

* Everyone will contribute equally to all tasks within the project, as discussed within team meetings

    * This includes contributing to discussions, creating code, and designing visualizations used in our final dashboard

    * Though some group members may have greater focus on some elements (dashboard formatting, presentation, etc.), we expect other non-participating members to offer guidance and assistance when necessary

* As we have other projects and assignments, we acknowledge that some members may not be available to work on the project consistently

* Our group chat will be our primary form of communication where we will provide updates on our project status and ask other members for help (if required)

* For deadlines, we hope to complete our work at least 2 days in advance of the submission date to make any final reviews/changes

* Finally, we all hope to achieve the highest quality work possible that we can achieve within the time frame of the project

    * Group members are expected to put in as much effort as they can to deliver a polished final deliverable

### Time Commitment

* Though we do not have a fixed time commitment on the project, we expect members to dedicate around 1-2 hours a night to working on project tasks

* Lab time should be used for project work as well

### Meetings

* Group members will meet at least once weekly during the lab time to discuss current tasks and coordinate future commitments

* Other meetings will be coordinated according to membersâ€™ availability as needed

* Meeting minutes will not be recorded, but we will send messages within our group chat to reiterate key points that were discussed
